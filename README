# DBOW

This thing produces standard "class files" for C, C++, Perl,
PHP and so on.  Not to mention the SQL table definitions.

Instead of defining a .sql file with the table information,
you define it in DBOW instead.  Run one option and DBOW will
produce the SQL table creation (for MySQL or whatever), run
another option and it will produce C source code to access
the database, fill a matching struct with the data and so
on.
