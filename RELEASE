This is a minor update of the DBOW code to fix some bugs found after
0.4 was released.  The biggest change is the addition of nested
queries so that dbow_query can be called recursively without affecting
the "upper" query.  Also added the stubs for supporting the 'function'
block which allows for a more granular approach to defining functions.
