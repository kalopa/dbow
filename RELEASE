This release of DBOW brings the C interface to a stable (BETA)
level, adds some new functionality and fixes a few bugs in the
back-end.  Added a 'db_findXXXfirst()' function for searching the
entire table.  Added a 'db_runXXXquery()' function which will run
an SQL statement (without parsing any arguments) and return the
first match.  Fixed a bug where the include() m4 statement was being
emitted more than once.  Put the 'EMIT' code at the bottom of the
output file.
