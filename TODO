Perl support is a must, as is a decent C++ interface derived from
the C stuff.  From there, things like Python, Java and so on would
be great.

The %type keyword presently only takes an argument of the form of
a generator type.  It would be good if this was a bit more advanced.
As in, "%type !C", or "%type C,C++" that sort of thing.  I'm also
wondering if it is feasible to extend the types to other things
like "C,Windows".  It might be better to let the C preprocessor
take care of that.


The %function keyword is unused at present.  It is intended for
things like:

	%function user {
		type=search
		var 1=user_id
		var 2=a1
		query="SELECT * FROM user WHERE user_id='$1' AND a1='$2'"
		name=findbyuserandaddr
	%}

The idea is to be able to create a rich set of functions in any
language merely by defining the SQL query.  As yet, this is
undeveloped.  Adding stuff to deal with SELECT order would be nice
too.
