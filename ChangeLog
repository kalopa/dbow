	* Extensive hacking to make the back-end use M4 instead of hard-coding
	  the output with printfs.

	* Modified the M4 back-end so that it uses looping rather than relying
	  on the front-end compiler to produce per-table fields.  This makes
	  the intermediate code cleaner and makes it a lot easier to write
	  advanced back-ends.  SQL is still hard-coded.
